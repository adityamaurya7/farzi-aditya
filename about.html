  <h1>About Our Club</h1>
  <p>
    The College Tech Club is a student-led community focused on innovation,
    coding, robotics, and emerging technologies. We aim to create a platform
    where students can share knowledge, build real projects, and participate in
    workshops and competitions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our mission is to help students grow by providing technical learning
    opportunities and hands-on experience in a friendly atmosphere. We welcome
    students from all branches who have a passion for learning and creating.
